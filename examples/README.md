# Examples

This directory contains several examples for how to use `loch` for GCMC water
sampling. Several scripts make use of the `grand.utils` module for performing
post-simulation analysis and visualization of the results. This can be installed
via:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/essex-lab/grand
```

* [bpti](bpti): GCMC water sampling for Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)
* [scytalone](scytalone): GCMC water sampling for Scytalone dehydratase (SD)
* [water](water): Bulk water sampling using GCMC
