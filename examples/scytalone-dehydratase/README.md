This example is a model of ligand1 in complex with one of the three monomeric units of scytalone dehydratase as found 
in PDB ID 3STD.
The PDB file was processed in Flare to export a protein pdb and a ligand sdf file. 
The notebook BSSsetup performs system setup and outputs a solvated topology of the complex. 
There should be a hydration site between Tyr23, Tyr 43 and the ligand's benzotriazine moiety.
